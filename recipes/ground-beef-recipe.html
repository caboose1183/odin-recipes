            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This is a recipe I came up with when I was helping to raise 6 kids. Every penny counted. You can add onions if desired.</p>

            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (12 ounce) package egg noodles </li>

                <li>1 pound ground beef </li>

                <li>1 teaspoon Greek seasoning (such as Cavender'sÂ®)</li>

                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>

                <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil </li>

                <li>1 (16 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms </li>

                <li>1 pint sour cream </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes; drain.</li>

                <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Season beef with Greek seasoning, salt, and pepper.</li>

                <li>Heat vegetable oil in a separate skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir mushrooms in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes; add to ground beef.</li>

                <li>Stir sour cream into ground beef mixture; cook and stir until hot, about 5 minutes. Serve over egg noodles.</li>
            </ol>
